    """Configuration for the web-search context-retrieval tool.

    When enabled, :func:`build_adk_agent` attaches a ``search_web``
    :class:`~google.adk.tools.FunctionTool` to the agent.  The tool calls
    the Vector proxy with Gemini's ``googleSearch`` server-side extension so
    the calling agent can retrieve grounded, sourced web context without a
    direct Gemini API key.

    Temporal cutoff enforcement has two layers. The first is soft
    (LLM-judgment-based): when ``enforce_cutoff`` is ``True`` and the calling
    agent passes a ``cutoff_date`` to the tool, the inner proxy prompt
    explicitly asks the model to exclude post-cutoff sources. This alone is
    not a hard guarantee — backtests have shown it leak real post-cutoff
    information despite the instruction. The second, hard layer is an
    independent verifier call (see ``verifier_model`` etc. below): a separate
    LLM call extracts and judges each factual claim in the search result
    against the cutoff, strips violations, and retries the search with
    feedback when it cannot produce a sufficiently confident result —
    returning an explicit failure sentinel rather than silently risky
    content if verification never succeeds within the attempt budget.

    Attributes
    ----------
    enabled : bool, default=False
        Whether to enable context retrieval. Disabled by default.
    search_model : str, default=LITE_MODEL (``"gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview"``)
        Proxy model used inside the ``search_web`` tool call.  Must be a
        model that supports the ``googleSearch`` server-side tool extension.
    instruction : str
        System prompt passed to the inner proxy call.  Should describe the
        search persona and what kind of output to return.  Must be non-empty
        when ``enabled`` is ``True``.
    enforce_cutoff : bool, default=True
        When ``True``, the ``search_web`` tool appends a cutoff-date
        constraint to the user prompt whenever ``cutoff_date`` is supplied by
        the calling agent, and runs the independent leakage verifier
        described above. Set to ``False`` for live (non-backtest) agents
        where no temporal fence is needed — the verifier is skipped entirely
        in that case, at zero extra cost.
    temperature : float | None, default=None
        Sampling temperature for the inner search call.
    max_output_tokens : int | None, default=None
        Maximum output tokens for the inner search call.
    verifier_model : str, default=ADVANCED_MODEL (``"gemini-3.5-flash"``)
        Model used for the independent leakage-verification call. Defaults
        to a different model than ``search_model`` so the verifier does not
        share the same blind spot as the call it's checking.
    verifier_max_attempts : int, default=3
        Maximum number of search-then-verify attempts before giving up and
        returning the ``[SEARCH_VERIFICATION_FAILED]`` sentinel.
    verifier_confidence_threshold : int, default=8
        Minimum self-reported confidence (1-10) the verifier must report,
        alongside a clean verdict, for a result to be accepted. Kept
        configurable rather than hardcoded because LLM self-reported
        confidence is not well-calibrated: too strict a bar (e.g. a literal
        10) risks exhausting retries on results that were actually fine.

You are an independent fact-checker verifying that a web search result contains \

Extract every discrete factual claim relevant to the query. For each claim, \
judge whether its *content* (the event itself, prices/figures referenced, \
described developments) could only be known on or after the cutoff date. \
Do NOT trust a source's claimed publish date, byline timestamp, or URL — \
page metadata and timestamps are frequently updated after original \
publication and are not reliable evidence of when the underlying facts \
became known. Reason from the substance of the claim itself.

For every claim that fails this test, report it as a removal. `quote` must be \
copied verbatim, character-for-character, from the text you were given — do \
not paraphrase, summarize, or reconstruct it; a span that does not appear in \
the original text will be treated as an error and discard your entire verdict. \
`reason` is a short explanation of the violation. `basis` records how you know \
the claim is post-cutoff: `stated_date` if the text itself dates the claim on \
or after the cutoff, or `world_knowledge` if you are relying on your own \
knowledge that the event happened on or after the cutoff even though the text \
does not date it.

Do not rewrite, summarize, or reproduce any other part of the text. Your only \
output is the list of spans to remove. `quote` must span the complete \
sentence(s) containing the violation -- never a sub-sentence fragment -- so \
that deleting it does not leave a grammatically broken remainder behind (e.g. \
do not quote just "on April 29" from "prices rose on April 29, analysts said"; \
quote the whole sentence). Set `confidence` (1-10) to how confident you are \

class AgentConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for building an ADK agent for forecasting tasks.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str, default="adk_forecasting_agent"
        Name of the agent.
    model : str | BaseLlm, default=LITE_MODEL (``"gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview"``)
        Model name (bare, no provider prefix) or a custom
        :class:`~google.adk.models.base_llm.BaseLlm` instance.  When
        ``openai_base_url`` is set and ``model`` is a plain string,
        :func:`build_adk_agent` wraps it in a
        :class:`~google.adk.models.lite_llm.LiteLlm` instance pointing to
        the proxy.  Pass a ``BaseLlm`` directly to skip automatic wrapping.
    openai_base_url : str | None, default=OPENAI_BASE_URL env var
        Base URL for the OpenAI-compatible LLM proxy.  Defaults to the
        ``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` environment variable.  When set, the agent (and
        the ``search_web`` tool) route all calls through the proxy.
    openai_api_key : str | None, default=OPENAI_API_KEY env var
        API key for the proxy.  Defaults to the ``OPENAI_API_KEY``
        environment variable.
    description : str, default=""
        Description of the agent. Useful when the agent is used as a sub-agent.
    instruction : str, default=""
        Instruction for the agent.
    skills_dirs : Sequence[Path], default=()
        Sequence of paths to skill directories.
    function_tools : Sequence[Any], default=()
        Conventional ADK tools (e.g. :class:`~google.adk.tools.FunctionTool`
        instances or plain callables) appended directly to the agent's tool
        list. Use this to give the agent a rigid, pre-specified capability such
        as the
        :class:`~aieng.forecasting.methods.agentic.forecast_tool.ForecastTool`
        (in contrast to open-ended code execution). Stored as-is; not validated.
    seed : int or None, default=None
        Generation seed forwarded to the model for reproducibility.
    temperature : float or None, default=None
        Sampling temperature; ``None`` uses the model default.
    max_output_tokens : int or None, default=None
        Maximum tokens per model response; ``None`` uses the model default.
    thinking_budget : int or None, default=None
        Token budget for extended thinking (Gemini thinking models only).
        **Proxy-path caveat:** when routing through the Vector proxy (or any
        OpenAI-compatible proxy), ``thinking_budget`` is passed via ADK's
        ``ThinkingConfig`` → ``GenerateContentConfig``. Whether LiteLLM's
        ``drop_params`` strips it on the proxy path is untested — if you set
        this and see no change in thinking behaviour, treat it as silently
        dropped (same root cause as the ``reasoning_effort`` stripping issue
        documented in ``planning-docs/vector-llm-proxy.md``).
    thinking_level : ThinkingLevel or None, default=None
        Thinking-level preset; overrides ``thinking_budget`` when both are set.
        Subject to the same proxy-path caveat as ``thinking_budget``.
    code_execution : CodeExecutionConfig
        Configuration for E2B code execution. Disabled by default.
    context_retrieval : ContextRetrievalConfig
        Configuration for web-search context retrieval. Disabled by default.
    disable_automatic_function_calling : bool or None, default=None
        When ``True``, sets ``automatic_function_calling.disable`` on the
        Gemini request config.  ADK agents execute tools via the ADK runtime,
        not the genai SDK's Automatic Function Calling (AFC) helper.
        ``None`` (default) auto-disables AFC whenever tools or an
        ``output_schema`` are configured.
    extra_tools : Sequence[Callable[..., Any]], default=()
        Additional callable tools to register with the agent beyond the
        standard code-execution and context-retrieval tools.  Use this to
        inject implementation-specific tools (e.g. adaptive skill mutation
        tools) without coupling the shared factory to implementation code.
        Each callable is appended to the tool list after skills are loaded
        and will be wrapped by ADK as a ``FunctionTool``.

    ----------
    config : AgentConfig
        Configuration for the agent.  ``config.instruction`` must be
        non-empty; if ``config.context_retrieval.enabled`` is ``True``,

    output_schema : type[AgentForecastOutput] or None, default=None
        When provided, configures the agent to return JSON constrained to
        this schema.  Typically supplied by :class:`AgentPredictor`.

        Note: avoid ``str | None`` optional fields on schemas that also
        contain ``list[BaseModel]`` fields; use string defaults (e.g.
        ``rationale=""``) to stay compatible with ADK's
