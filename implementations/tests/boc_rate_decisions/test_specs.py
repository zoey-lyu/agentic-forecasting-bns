"""Consistency tests between the BoC specs and the committed meeting calendar.

The specs list forecast origins explicitly (the meeting calendar is
irregular), which creates a maintenance hazard: the origin lists and
``meeting_schedule.yaml`` can drift apart silently. These tests pin the
contract that every origin is exactly ``announcement - lead`` for a
scheduled meeting, where ``lead`` is the spec's own horizon, and that the
canonical windows cover their meetings without gaps.
