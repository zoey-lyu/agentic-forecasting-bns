# implementations

Self-contained reference implementations and their helper code.

This is a local uv workspace package. It is installed automatically when you run `uv sync` from the repository root, but it is not a separately published public API.

Some use cases are notebook-only. Others expose a small importable helper package so shared analysis, plotting, or data-registration code can live in Python modules instead of large notebook cells.

## Directory layout

Numbered in the recommended order (mirrors the bootcamp progression: conventional numerical methods → LLM Processes → agents → agentic evaluation). The directories are not renamed — the numbers are an ordering convention used across the docs, and each directory stays an importable package (`from sp500_forecasting.data import ...`).

```text
implementations/
|-- getting_started/          # 0 · CPI gasoline hello-world (start here)
|   `-- specs/                #     backtest and eval YAML
|-- sp500_forecasting/        # 1 · S&P 500 multivariate numerical comparison (financial markets)
|   `-- specs/                #     backtest YAML (smoke + full)
|-- food_price_forecasting/   # 2 · CFPR-style food CPI experiment
|   `-- specs/                #     backtest YAML
|-- energy_oil_forecasting/   # 3 · Daily WTI oil price forecasting experiment
|   `-- specs/                #     backtest and eval YAML
|-- boc_rate_decisions/       # 4 · BoC cut/hold/hike + cutoff-grounded research agent
|   `-- specs/                #     direction + binary backtest / eval / smoke YAML
|-- tests/                    # tests for implementation-specific helper modules
`-- pyproject.toml            # local workspace packaging
```

YAML backtest and eval specs live under each use case in `specs/`. Each directory is independent; see its `README.md` for the walkthrough.

Every domain use case (all except `getting_started`) also ships a `starter_agent/` module and a `99_starter_agent.ipynb` — a fresh, hackable **starter agent** that is the consistent "build your own" entry point for that use case (toggleable news search + code execution, two lightweight tool-usage skills, an interactive cell, and one scored forecast).

The BoC use case additionally ships `04_research_grounded_forecast.ipynb` and
`run_research_agent.py` for inspecting cutoff-visible evidence and the exact
agent prompt before an optional live prediction.

`getting_started/` additionally ships a **`concierge_agent/`** module and **`99_repo_concierge.ipynb`** — a repo onboarding helper (not a forecaster) that answers questions about how the codebase works using a committed public-`main` knowledge digest. From the repository root: `uv run adk run implementations/getting_started/concierge_agent`. See [`getting_started/README.md`](getting_started/README.md) and the notebook for full usage.

## Relationship to `aieng-forecasting`

- `aieng-forecasting` (`aieng.forecasting`) owns reusable infrastructure and reusable reference predictors under `aieng.forecasting.methods`.
- `implementations/` owns use-case material: walkthrough notebooks, experiment-specific helper modules, plotting/analysis code, and task-specific framing.

If code becomes broadly reusable across use cases, promote it into `aieng-forecasting`.

## Adding a new use case

1. Create `implementations/<use-case>/`.
2. Add a `README.md` describing the task, the data, and what the notebooks cover.
3. Add YAML specs under `implementations/<use-case>/specs/`.
4. Start with notebooks as the primary user surface.
5. If notebook code becomes bulky or repeated, extract small helper modules into that use-case directory.
6. Add tests under `implementations/tests/<use-case>/` for non-trivial helper logic.
7. Promote code into `aieng-forecasting` once it is clearly reusable across more than one use case.
